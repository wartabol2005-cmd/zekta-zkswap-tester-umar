# ⚡ ZEKTA ZKSWAP SDK Tester Report

## 🧭 Overview
This repository documents my participation in the **ZEKTA SDK Build Contest (2025)** as an independent **tester** focusing on the **ZKSWAP SDK** — a module designed for private DeFi transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.

The goal was to evaluate setup, testnet performance, and privacy transaction flow using the SDK before Zekta's mainnet release.
