# 🧾 ZEKTA SDK Feedback Report  
### Submitted by: Umar (Independent Tester)

## 🧠 Overview
This report summarizes my experience testing the **ZEKTA ZKSWAP SDK**, a privacy-focused software development kit designed to support private swaps and zero-knowledge-based DeFi transactions.

As a **tester without a developer background**, my main goal was to understand installation flow, functionality, and user experience when using the SDK in a test environment.

---

## 🔍 Testing Objectives
- Evaluate the **installation and setup process** for non-technical users.  
- Test **basic transaction privacy functions** and simulate swap operations.  
- Observe **error handling** and **testnet behavior**.  
- Provide **usability feedback** to improve SDK clarity and documentation.

---

## ⚙️ Testing Process

### 1. Setup
- Followed the official [ZEKTA SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/zektaio/zekta-sdk).  
- Installed Node.js and dependencies as recommended.  
- Verified connection to the testnet environment.  

### 2. Execution
- Ran example test commands from SDK docs.  
- Observed privacy-related parameters and logs.  
- Checked transaction privacy consistency across different runs.

### 3. Observation Summary
| Test Step | Result | Notes |
|:-----------|:--------|:------|
| Installation | ✅ Successful | Needed clearer beginner guide |
| Testnet Swap Simulation | ✅ Successful | Smooth transaction |
| Error Handling | ⚠️ Minor | Missing input validation messages |
| Documentation Clarity | ⚠️ Average | Add step-by-step tutorial for new testers |

---

## 💬 Key Insights
- The SDK is well-structured for **privacy-first applications**.  
- Documentation can be made more **accessible to non-developers**.  
- Logging and feedback messages are clear but could use **simpler wording**.  
- Performance and testnet response were **stable and efficient**.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
1. Provide a **Quick Start Testing Guide** for beginners.  
2. Add a **visual flow diagram** showing how private swaps are processed.  
3. Include an **auto-test script** to verify key SDK functions faster.  
4. Offer a “Test Mode” that runs without blockchain deployment for practice.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
The **ZEKTA ZKSWAP SDK** demonstrates a strong foundation for private DeFi transactions and ZK-based swaps.  
As a tester, I found the SDK **intuitive, modular, and ready for mainnet deployment** after minor documentation refinements.  

This testing experience helped me understand Zekta’s approach to privacy and gave me valuable insight into zero-knowledge integration.
