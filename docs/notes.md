# üß† ZEKTA SDK Testing Notes

## üß© Test Summary
This section summarizes my testing experience while exploring the **ZKSWAP (Private Transactions)** SDK module.

The goal was to understand how the SDK handles **transaction privacy**, **user setup**, and **testnet behavior** from a tester‚Äôs point of view ‚Äî without deep coding experience.

## üîç Observations

1. **Setup Simplicity:**  
   The installation steps from the GitHub repository were clear, but it could use simpler step-by-step commands for beginners.

2. **Documentation Quality:**  
   The SDK‚Äôs README and examples are informative. However, more screenshots or visual examples would help new testers understand how the private swap flow works.

3. **Testing Flow:**  
   I simulated basic swap test scenarios following the documentation.  
   - Transaction initiation was smooth.  
   - Privacy-related configuration steps were understandable.  
   - Some test dependencies (e.g., environment setup) required clarification.

4. **Performance Impression:**  
   The SDK appears optimized for lightweight privacy operations.  
   Even without full integration, its modular structure shows good potential for real private DeFi swaps.

## üí° Suggestions

- Add beginner-friendly setup examples (like CLI snippets).  
- Include a ‚ÄúQuick Test Mode‚Äù for testers to run basic privacy swap checks without needing a full environment.  
- Provide video or visual step guides.

## üßæ Conclusion

Even as a **non-coder tester**, this SDK feels well-designed for privacy transactions.  
It gives a strong foundation for future builders aiming to create secure, anonymous, and verifiable DeFi systems.  
Contributing through testing helps ensure a stable mainnet launch for the Zekta ecosystem.
